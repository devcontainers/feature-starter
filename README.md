## Usage

<img align=right src="https://i.imgur.com/woHa37r.png">

**Click <kbd>Use this template</kbd>!** That's the first step. After
instantiating this template repo, there are a few things you'll need to do
manually:

1. Change the name in the `LICENSE` file to be your name or your organization's
   name. Right now it's `YOUR_NAME`.

2. Remove the top half of this readme. After reading it of course.

3. Change any of the other readme text to match your own new awesome feature
   collection. üöÄ

Remember how you can use features like this?

```jsonc
// devcontainer.json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node": {}
  }
}
```

Guess what? This is how those features are made! üç∞ This is a monorepo. There's
multiple features paired up with counterpart folders in `src/` and `test/`. For
example, the `hello` feature has a `src/hello/` folder with the
`devcontainer-feature.json` manifest file and the actual `install.sh` script
along with some tests in `test/hello/`. You can try out the tests and see
`hello` in action by running:

```sh
devcontainer features test -f hello
```

üìö For more information on how Dev Container Features work, check out some of
our [Guides]!

üí° Pro tip: All of the `options: { optionName: { ... } }` fields that you define
in the `devcontainer-feature.json` file will be mapped to env `$OPTIONNAME` vars
in `install.sh` so your installer script can respond to them. Here's a sample of
a `$VERSION` option that you might use to install a specific version of a tool:

```jsonc
{
  "options": {
    "version": {
      "type": "string",
      "default": "3.6.2"
    }
  }
}
```

üìï You can find some more sample options in the `src/` of the demo features.

To publish your features, just run the <kbd>Publish features</kbd> workflow in
the <kbd>Actions</kbd> tab. This will automagically ‚ú® package and push your
Features to `ghcr.io/<you>/<your-repo>/*` so you can use them! You'll even see
them appear on the sidebar in the GitHub web UI.

After you've created your amazing feature collection, you might want to add it
to the official index so that it can be listed in autocomplete in tools like VS
Code and GitHub Codespaces. ü§© Just
[open an Issue Form on the devcontainers/collections repo](https://github.com/devcontainers2/collections/issues/new?template=add-collection.yml)
and some magic will happen to add it to our index file.
